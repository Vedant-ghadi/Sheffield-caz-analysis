> **A rigorous time series analysis evaluating the causal effectiveness of Sheffield's 2023 Clean Air Zone (CAZ) intervention on Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) concentrations.**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

This study employs **counterfactual inference** and **interrupted time series (ITS) regression** to quantify the impact of the Sheffield Clean Air Zone implemented on February 27, 2023. By analyzing **35,064 hourly observations** (Jan 2022 – Dec 2025) and controlling for seasonality and exogenous factors, this analysis demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in traffic-related pollution.

### 🏆 Key Findings

*   **Significant Reduction:** The CAZ intervention drove a **41% weather-normalised reduction** in NO₂ concentrations.
*   **Structural Break:** Statistical testing confirms a highly significant structural break ($p < 0.001$) at the intervention date.
*   **Weather Robustness:** Results hold even after accounting for wind speed, temperature, and precipitation using XGBoost.
*   **Model Agreement:** 
    *   **ITS Regression:** Estimated -2.35 µg/m³ immediate drop.
    *   **Prophet Forecast:** Observed values 44.2% below counterfactual baseline.
    *   **ARIMA Baseline:** Observed values 29.9% below baseline.

## 🔬 Technical Methodology

To ensure robustness, this analysis utilizes a multi-model approach to isolate the policy effect from natural variation.

### 1. Baseline Forecasting (ARIMA & Prophet)
Constructed a "business as usual" counterfactual based on pre-intervention dynamics. The **Prophet** model captured complex multi-seasonal patterns (yearly, weekly), revealing that traditional ARIMA methods may underestimate the effect size when strong seasonalities are present.

### 2. Machine Learning Weather Normalisation (XGBoost)
Used Gradient Boosting to model non-linear relationships between weather (wind, temperature) and pollution. This proved that the reduction was driven by emissions changes, not favorable weather conditions.

### 3. Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Regression
Formal statistical test for causal structural breaks.
*   **Level Change:** Immediate drop ($\beta_2 = -2.35$, $p<0.01$).
*   **Trend Change:** Accelerated rate of improvement ($\beta_3 = -0.014$, $p<0.001$).
