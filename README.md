> **A rigorous time series analysis evaluating the causal effectiveness of Sheffield's 2023 Clean Air Zone (CAZ) intervention on Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) concentrations.**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

This study employs **counterfactual inference** and **interrupted time series (ITS) regression** to quantify the impact of the Sheffield Clean Air Zone implemented on February 27, 2023.

By analyzing **35,064 hourly observations** (Jan 2022 – Dec 2025) and controlling for seasonality and exogenous factors, this analysis demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in traffic-related pollution.

**Key Results:**
*   **Significance:** The intervention caused a statistically observable structural break in NO₂ levels (**p < 0.001**).
*   **Magnitude:** Estimated reduction of **30%–44%** compared to the counterfactual baseline.
*   **Trend:** Immediate level drop followed by a sustained downward trajectory.

## 🔬 Technical Methodology

To ensure robustness, this analysis utilizes three independent statistical frameworks to isolate the policy effect from natural variation (weather, seasonality, and secular trends).

### 1. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Forecasting
*   **Objective:** Construct a baseline counterfactual ("business as usual") based on pre-intervention dynamics.
*   **Specification:** `ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,0,0)[7]` with weekly seasonality.
*   **Result:** Actual post-intervention NO₂ levels diverged **29.9%** below the ARIMA forecast ($RMSE = 8.38$).

### 2. Bayesian Structural Time Series (Prophet)
*   **Objective:** Model complex multi-seasonal patterns (yearly, weekly, daily) using a decomposable time series model.
*   **Specification:** Additive regression model with non-linear trends and holiday effects.
*   **Result:** The model estimates a **44.2% reduction**, suggesting that traditional ARIMA methods may underestimate the effect size when strong seasonalities are present.

### 3. Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Regression
*   **Objective:** Formally test for causal structural breaks using segmented regression.
*   **Model:** $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 D + \beta_3 P + \epsilon_t$
    *   $D$ (Intervention): Immediate level change ($\beta_2 = -2.35$, $p=0.002$)
    *   $P$ (Time since intervention): Slope change ($\beta_3 = -0.014$, $p<0.001$)
*   **Conclusion:** The policy resulted in both an immediate drop and an accelerated rate of improvement.

## 📉 Visualizing the Structural Break

The dashboard below visualizes the raw time series against the intervention timeline. Note the clear shift in the data distribution post-February 2023, validated by the flattening of the trend line despite seasonal fluctuations.

### Forecast vs. Actuals
The divergence between the **counterfactual forecast (dotted)** and **observed data (solid)** represents the "clean air dividend" generated by the policy.
